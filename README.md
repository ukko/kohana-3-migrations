# About

This Kohana module provides simple migrations from the command line for SQL compliant databases.

# Warning
Migration module depends on module Console, so you must first install and connect the module Console
https://github.com/ukko/kohana-3-console

# Using

Create a folder named "migrations" in your application folder.  This directory must be writable, or must contain a directory called ".info" which is writable.

Put valid SQL files in that folder, following the naming patterns: 001.sql, 002.sql, etc.

For example:

	001.sql
	002.sql
	003.sql
	004.sql

Now add this module to your application/bootstrap.php file.

    'migrations'    => MODPATH . 'migrations',

Then you can run them from the command line:
